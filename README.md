CSC4360 Mobile App Development
Team 1's Group Project

The entire Android Studio project is in this repository. The only files that aren't part of the Android Studio project 
are this README file & files located in the folders Other Important Files and Reminders Files. To get the files here, either
download them directly as a ZIP file or use Git Bash. For this Android Studio project, we programmed it using Android API 27.

Tools Used (subject to change):
Android Studio,
MySQL Server & Workbench (and the JDBC Connector for MySQL), and
Github for version control
